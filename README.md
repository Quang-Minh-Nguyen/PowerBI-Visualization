# Data visualization in Power BI

In this project, I cleaned, manipulated and visualized the month-to-date sales data from a FMCG brand. To be more specific, descriptive analysis was used to track the sales timeline by regions and products. Besides, the products which have decent performance was also identified in the report. I only used 1 tool in this project which was the Power BI.

## Step 1: Importing & Transforming Data

From my experience, I always want to look into the files before importing them. In this case, the data was a Excel files with 3 sheets: Calendar, Sales and Target

Next, I imported 3 sheets into Power BI and began to transforme them.
