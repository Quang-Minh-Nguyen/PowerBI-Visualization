# Data visualization in Power BI

In this project, I clean, manipulate and visualize the month-to-date sales data from a FMCG brand. To be more specific, descriptive analysis will be used to track the sales timeline by regions and products. Besides, the products which have decent performance will be also identified in the report. I only use 1 tool in this project which is Power BI.

From my experience, I always want to look into the files before importing them. In this case, the data is a Excel files with 3 sheets: Calendar, Sales and Target
