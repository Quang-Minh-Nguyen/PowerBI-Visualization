# Data visualization in Power BI

In this project, I clean, manipulate and visualize the monthly sales data from a FMCG brand. To be more specific, descriptive analysis will be used to track the sales timeline by regions and products. Besides, the products which have decent performance will be also identified in the report. I only use 1 tool in this project which is Power BI.
